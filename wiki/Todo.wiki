#summary my todo list

= Introduction =

I use this to keep track of coding.

*Important:*
  * write some help before I release fully
  * add warp editor
  * nsic sections and unselected
  * header buffer
  * patching warning of size: sprites
  * overworld paths
  * colorise pipes from warp
  * patching changes checksums (header and rom)
  * XOR saves to hide content
  * serial key:
    * rtrim id last 5 digits
    * convert '-'in id to '~'
    * start each id with ident (M,H,P,E)
    * id > 5 char
    * only add emergency id when low on id's

*Good:*

  * trial version can't load
  * drop down list of tile sets
  * cursor changes
  * add that you can't view patched ROM
  * better error messages, trace back.
  * add importing / exporting tileset
  * round robin status text
  * hex numbers (if x in)
  * show sprite while dragging
  * warning on import to different level
  * select tool only works one way, drag anyway
  * exit: show what changes have been made that will get lost

*OK:*

  * explanation box (hints)
  * batch patch file (maps, sprites everything linked in an .ini)
  * spider diagram program and make better
  * drawing of tile-map shows pattern before displays in wine
  * multi select on global>tilemap editor
  * seperate smart block functions (check boxs)
  * blockdata: per tileset paletting, maybe load psp ini
  * autosave

*No hurry:*

  * edit names in combobox
  * different size icons for everything
  * put all the lables into label1
  * ctrl paint gui
  * icons for tabs
  * center_on sub, steal code from minimap_click (fix auto-center when zoomed in + zoom centers on where you zoom)
  * combo-box text not editable
  * combine tile loading of Mario and Wario.
  * better save to ROM (optimise load_all_levels)
  * change bubble-sort of sprites to quick-sort
  * patch a level
  * fix generic tiles with palette loading (maybe add that when palette loads it reuses colours already set)
  * HUD editor,music, etc
  * add unzip hits end of line?
  * second credits?
  * polish re-size form,icon,config


*Mario 3:*

  * Wario map names
  * map tiles
  * header!


*Mario 1:*

  * Figure level format
  * find header
