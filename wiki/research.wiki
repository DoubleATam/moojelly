  * Bytes 00 to 03 (D4 01 22 00)	- Mario's starting coordinates. D4 01 = X, 22 00 = Y.
  * Bytes 04 to 07 (C0 01 50 00)	- Screen focus coordinates. C0 01 = X, 50 00 = Y.
  * Byte 08 (00)					- Screen focus shift. Not practically useful in any way.
  * Byte 09 (58)					- No idea. If you figure this one out, be sure to contact me.
  * Byte 0A (00)					- Level number.
  * Bytes 0B and 0C (00 40)			- Tilemap pointers. All from bank 8.
  * Byte 0D (09)					- Map bank.
  * Byte 0E (01)					- Music.
  * Bytes 0F to 11 (E4 D0 38)		- Palettes. E4 = Background, D0 = Sprite, 38 = Sprite.
  * Byte 12 (00)					- Second map byte.
  * Byte 13 (04)					- Time. (Multiply by 0x64 to get the time in Decimal)
